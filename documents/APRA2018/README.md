# Outline


Analysis / graphics /questions we will need:
1. What are the brightest known transiting-planet host stars? What will TESS find?


2. How small of a telescope can you measure an exoplanet transit with?

- S/N versus telescope aperture for fixed J-mag
- S/N versus J-mag for fixed telescope aperture


3. How does this mission compare with existing or proposed missions?

- JWST  (slated for launch)
- CUTE (in development)
- FINESSE (proposed)
- Ground-based (Recent Giano paper, others)

4. What is the advantage of going to space?
- Stability
- Continuous monitoring (point and stare)
- Low/no background or telluric absorption

5. What is the nominal design of the spectrograph?
- Largest possible aperture that can fit in the cubesat
- Si Grism
- Custom MIT Lincoln Lab detector

6. What is the orbital configuration?
- Either Earth orbiting (TESS) or Earth trailing (Kepler, CUTE)
- Earth orbiting preferred for communications

7. What is the nominal operation of a cubesat with the proposed design?
- Identify a few or even just one good bright target(s)
- Adapt orbit to continuously view targets continuously or for ~month-long campaigns
- Just point and stare and collect tens of thousands of spectra
- Model the in- and out- of spectra transits

8. What are the best targets?
- Would need to be bright, as already shown
- Would need to have planets with close-in orbits to increase the number of transits viewable in a campaign duration
- Such planets would be highly irradiated.

9. What is the unique, new science
- Measuring the near-IR spectrum of a planet (still few examples)
- Detect water from molecular bands in the near-IR

10. Why is transit spectroscopy so hard?

11. What will you actually do for APRA 2018?

12. Who will do the work?  Where?

13. What are the costs?

14. What other things to say?
- Demonstrate the low-cost cubesat platform.
- Demonstrate resilient strategies for calibrating instruments in Earth orbit.
- Innovations in software and modeling.
- Simulate a transit spectrum retrieval
- See Caroline Morley simulations
